# Fix Summary

## 1. Fixed Next.js 15 Params Promise Issue

### Files Updated:
- `src/app/product/[id]/page.tsx` - Client component using `use(params)`
- `src/app/admin/customers/[id]/page.tsx` - Server component using `await params`
- `src/app/admin/products/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Client component using `use(params)`

### Changes Made:
1. **Client Components**: Added `use` import from React and unwrapped params with `const { id } = use(params)`
2. **Server Components**: Changed to `const { id } = await params`
3. **Updated Type Definitions**: Changed `params: { id: string }` to `params: Promise<{ id: string }>`
4. **Fixed Dependencies**: Updated all useEffect dependencies from `params.id` to `id`

## 2. Enhanced Product Deletion with Image Cleanup

### File Updated:
- `src/app/api/admin/products/[id]/route.ts`

### Enhanced DELETE Function:
1. **Fetches all associated files before deletion**:
   - Variant images from `variant_images` table
   - Audio files from `products.audio_url`
   - Trading card images from `products.trading_card_image`

2. **Deletes physical files from filesystem**:
   - Converts database URLs to filesystem paths
   - Uses `fs.unlink()` to remove files
   - Graceful error handling if files don't exist

3. **Database deletion with transaction**:
   - Uses database transactions for atomicity
   - Leverages CASCADE DELETE for related records
   - Provides detailed logging and error handling

### Benefits:
- **Prevents orphaned files**: No more unused images taking up disk space
- **Complete cleanup**: Removes variant images, audio files, and trading cards
- **Transaction safety**: Database and filesystem operations are coordinated
- **Detailed logging**: Easy debugging and monitoring of deletion process

## Testing Checklist:
